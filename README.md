This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## git-gazer

This project was built for stackathon 2019

### `What it does`

Inspired by the so-called 'star-gazers' of Github, this app visually shows the power of open-source collaboration. Using React, GraphQL, Apollo, and Githubâ€™s API, git-gazer displays how 'far around the world' any given repository has 'travelled' by way of forks.

### `How`

Given a github user and repository name, git-gazer will fetch the locations of all repositories that have been built off of the given repo.

### `npm run build`
